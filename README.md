## 🤖 Creating Your Own Agent
All trading bots (agents) are stored in the `agents/` folder.
To build your own bot:

1. Create a new file inside the `agents/` folder.
2. Inherit from the `Agent` class.
3. Implement your custom trading logic.
4. Add the bot to `ACTIVE_BOT` variable inside `logic_processor.py`.
5. Change logic in `logic_processor.py` to execute more complex logic.
