## 🤖 Creating Your Own Agent
All trading bots (agents) are stored in the `agents/` folder.
To build your own bot:

1. Create a new file inside the `agents/` folder.
2. Inherit from the `Agent` class.
3. Implement your custom trading logic.
4. Add the bot to `ACTIVE_BOT` variable inside `logic_processor.py`.
5. Change logic in `logic_processor.py` to execute more complex logic.

## Using tunnel
The folder /tunnel is an independent module, used to create a tunnel to execute order through API.
To use it:

1. Download cloudflared at: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/downloads/
2. Run main.py to generate "entrade_client_data.json" inside "/tunnel" (main.py could be closed after)
3. Run tunnel.py
